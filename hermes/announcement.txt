Announcing Hermes, a sleek and smooth iOS app for YouTube.

Hey guys!

For about 6 months now, I've been developing a brand-new YouTube app and I think it's at the stage where I can announce it to everyone. I call it Hermes.

I've been using YouTube since around 2009, and I've always enjoyed taking part in the community and watching videos. YouTube is almost essential for the internet imo, and I wanted to make an app that reflects that. I don't have a ton of experience programming for iOS (in fact, this is my first fully-fledged app), but I've poured a ton of work into this and I'm pretty proud of how it's coming.

I wanted to put a big emphasis on making the experience as easy and comfortable as possible, with smooth gestures, lots of customization, and an experience that fits right in with iOS.

Plus, it has a dark mode, no ads, and background play.

It's not quite feature-complete and a while away from being launch-ready, but I'd like to get some input from the Reddit community to see what you guys want in a YouTube app.

#FAQ

**Is this allowed by YouTube?**

It's in a bit of a gray area, but there are a few other apps that made it onto the App Store without any pushback, so I'm leaning towards "yes."

**Will there be a beta?**

I'd like there to be! Unfortunately, I'm a broke high school student, but I should be able to scrape together enough money to get into the developer program and submit it.

**Is it really ad-free?**

Yep! Even if I wanted to add ads, the YouTube API doesn't support them, so it's pretty much impossible.
